##  HALLOWEEN-CANDY-WINPERCENT

Predict the winpercent of halloween candies


# Company Introduction
Client for this project is a Candy Selling Company.

 - This company sells a large variety of candies worldwide.
 -  They want to supply the highest quality of candies which most people will prefer  to receive on halloween. 
 - To find the most popular candy, they need to analyze different characteristics of the candy as per the data  collected through the survey.

# Current Scenario

 - It is very tough to know the candies preferred by people to receive on Halloween. 
 - Currently, they estimate the popularity of candies based on their previous sales but this does not give the ideal results.


**The current process suffers from the following problems:**

-   The popularity of candies derived from the previous sales records is not an ideal estimate of actual popularity.
-   The sales can also be affected by bulk orders as well and this might not give us the actual popularity.

  

The company has hired you as data science consultants.

They want to  **automate**  the process of  **predicting**  the winning percentage of halloween candies which people would prefer to receive.

#### **Your Role**

-   You are given a dataset containing 85 different candies and their characteristics in form of features.
-   Your task is to build a regression model using the dataset.
-   Because there was no machine learning model for this problem in the company, you donâ€™t have a quantifiable win condition. You need to build the best possible model.

  

#### **Project Deliverables**

-   Deliverable:  **Predict the winpercent of halloween candies**.
-   Machine Learning Task:  **Regression**
-   Target Variable:  **winpercent**
-   Win Condition:  **N/A (best possible model)**
